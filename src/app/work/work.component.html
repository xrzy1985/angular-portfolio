                Job Description | I know I want to stick to front end work, but as far as frameworks, I am an open book. The bottom
                line for me is that I love to program, solve problems, and get paid to do so. I strive to find a good solid team that
                wants to produce high quality software without forgetting the simple fact that we all should continue to grow. If I
                know one thing for certain, it is the fact that I do not know everything. I'll definitely be looking forward to the
                next challenge that will present itself.
