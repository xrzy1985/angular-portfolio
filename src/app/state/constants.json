            "details": "Good day, I hope you're well when you find yourself reading this section. When I first graduated high school, I attempted to start my college career; the result was a big failure and a waste of time. I would need to grow up and learn the value of hard work before I could think about starting again. Eventually, I would restart and find myself back at Dalton State College, and graduating with an A.S. in computer science. Furthering my degree path would take me to Kennesaw where I would attend Southern Polytechnic State University to start working on a B.S. in computer science. SPSU was eventually merged with Kennesaw State University, and that is how I became a KSU student. I graduated from Kennesaw State University's College of Computing and Software Engineering with a 3.71 GPA majoring in computer science."

            "details":"What are some of my hobbies and interests? I love to be outdoors; hiking, biking, walking, etc. When I can, I always go down to the local park to get a few miles under the sun. My dog and I enjoy hiking along the Ocoee river towards Tennessee. I am a avid video game player, and a even larger collector of physical games. I love to play music on my guitar or mandolin, especially blues. Finally, I do really enjoy programming. The first time I made a computer print out, Hello World, I was hooked."

            "details": "The primary goal I have is to continue growing through experience. I can easily pick up new frame works and concepts. So, I am less concerned with the tech stack I end up using, and more focused on the team I would join. I much prefer to continue as a front end engineer, but if the right opportunity for full stack presented itself; I would have to consider the offer."

            "details": "I am currently working as a front end software engineer at Tillster Inc. My primary responsibilities are to maintain, improve, and implement new features within a desktop angular js application known as the call center. The application was in a bad state when I first came onto the company. The application had breaking errors, failing api requests, and extreme data leakage. After a year, I was able to get the application in a decent state. We were able to complete a cycle from the beginning to the end. We have now been in production for a little over a year, and currently, proud to say, is one of the largest portions of revenue for the company."
